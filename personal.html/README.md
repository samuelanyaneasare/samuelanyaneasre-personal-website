# Personal Website

A fast, accessible, and responsive personal website. Edit the placeholders in `index.html` with your details.

## Develop

- Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click) or use a simple server:

```bash
# Python 3
python -m http.server 8080

# Or with Node (if installed)
npx serve . -l 8080 --single --yes
```

Then visit `http://localhost:8080/personal.html/` (or the path where these files live).

## Customize

- Replace `[Your Name]` in `index.html` and social links in the footer.
- Update the hero image `img` in the hero section.
- Add real project links in the Projects cards.
- Tweak colors in `styles.css` by adjusting CSS variables in `:root`.

## Deploy

- You can host this static site on GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel. Upload the folder `personal.html/` as-is.
